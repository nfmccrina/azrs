# AzRs

This is intended to be a Rust library for accessing Azure resources, and also a program to manage Azure resources written in Rust. Currently this is only a hobby project so there may be massive breaking changes or no changes at all. To run the tests and use the library you need an azrs.toml config file in the root of the source tree with the keys "host", "credential", "secret" and "api_version" defined.
